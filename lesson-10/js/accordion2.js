// STEP 6: Nab all the SUMMARY elements
const details = document.querySelectorAll("details");

// STEP 7: Loop through the element array, and add an event listener for the toggle event
details.forEach((detail) => {
	console.log(detail);
	detail.addEventListener("toggle", (event) => {
		// STEP 8a: Check to see whether the DETAILS event that was toggled has the "open" attribute
		console.log(event);
		if (event.target.open) {
			// STEP 8b: The browser just added the "open" attribute, so this DETAILS element was previously closed
			details.forEach((detail) => {
				// STEP 8c: If this DETAILS element is NOT the one that was just clicked, close it by removing the "open" attribute
				if(detail !== event.target){
					detail.removeAttribute("open");
				}
			});
		}
	});
});

//STEP 9: Verify that it works in the browser
