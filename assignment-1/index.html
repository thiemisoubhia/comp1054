                    <p>Maybe we can
                        Find a place to feel good
                        And we can treat people with kindness
                        Find a place to feel good</p>
                    <h5>[Verse 1: Harry Styles]</h5>
                    <p>I've got a good feeling
                        I'm just takin' it all in
                        Floating up and dreamin'
                        Droppin' into the deep end</p>

                        And if we're here long enough
                        They'll sing a song for us (Ooh)

                    <p>Given second chances
                        I don't need all the answers
                        Feeling good in my skin
                        I just keep on dancin</p>

                    <p>And it's just another day (And it's just another day)
                        And if our friends all pass away (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
                        It's okay (It's okay, it's okay)
                        It's okay (It's okay, it's okay, yeah)
