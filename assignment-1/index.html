            <p>“It’s about being a lot nicer to each other rather than, ‘Don’t do this, or don’t do that, not this yes
                that.’ It’s just saying, ‘<strong>Treat people with kindness</strong>,’ you know.” -Harry Style</p>

                <p>Choosing “<strong>Treat People With Kindness</strong>” was actually an easy decision for this project
                    because it represents more than just a melody; it is a lifestyle. I picked this track to highlight
                    how Harry Styles transformed a simple tour slogan into a global movement of radical empathy. In a
                    world that often feels cynical, this song serves as a vibrant reminder that being nice is a choice
                    we make every single day. I love how the vintage gospel choir elements create an atmosphere of
                    collective joy, making the listener feel part of something bigger. By featuring this song, I wanted
                    to capture that specific energy, the courage to be kind even when it is difficult. It resonates
                    with me because it balances self-love with outward compassion, proving that we can only truly uplift
                    others once we feel good in our own skin.</p>

                    <p>Harry Styles is an English singer, songwriter, and actor who first rose to fame as a member of
                        the
                        hugely successful boy band One Direction. After the band went on hiatus, he began a solo career
                        that
                        has made him one of the most popular artists in contemporary pop music. Styles is known for
                        blending
                        classic rock, pop, and soul influences into his music, and for his charismatic stage presence.
                        His
                        work often emphasizes themes of love, self-expression, and personal growth. Styles has received
                        critical acclaim and a large international fan base. One of his notable messages, “<strong>Treat
                            People With Kindness</strong>,” became a mantra during his live shows and later inspired the
                        song of the same name.
