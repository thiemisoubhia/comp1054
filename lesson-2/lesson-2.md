*Visual Hierarchy* - Communicating Relative Importance
Consider a Typographic Scale

*Contrast*

*Leading* - Spacing Between Lines
line-height: 1.5;

*Tracking* - Spacing Between Characters
letter-spacing: 0.2em;

_Kerning is the process of adjusting the space between individual pairs of letters (or other characters) to create visually pleasing and evenly spaced text, improving readability and aesthetics, especially in headlines or logos where specific letter combinations (like 'AV' or 'To') look awkward with standard spacing. It focuses on optical balance, ensuring the perceived white space between each letter pair feels consistent, unlike tracking, which adjusts space uniformly across an entire word or block of text._

*Measure* - Controlling Line Length
width: 80vw;

*Whitespace* - Margins, Gutters (GAP), & Indentation

*Justification* - How Line Breaks Are Handled
